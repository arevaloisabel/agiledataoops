# Agile Data Platform

Architecture and documentation for a truly agile data platform

## Introduction

This repository is intended to provide examples and explanations of how to architect a modern cloud data platform which is driven by DevOps processes and allows enterprise scale in terms of both capability and work throughput. It is designed to remove unnecessary blockers and issues which arise with more traditional approaches by following the example of application development. Concepts such as "Cattle vs Pets" and loose coupling will be central to this architecture, alongside a modular approach with strong, contract based interactions between components.
