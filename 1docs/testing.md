# Structured Testing

## Why Test?

Increase Quality
Increase Confidence
Reduce time to deploy
Improved Security
Reduced cost through smaller, ephemeral environments

## Choosing a Framework

## Types of Test
Unit vs integration
Automatic vs manual
Performance/capacity vs functional


## Test Data

Generate known good test data


## What to Test

EVERYTHING

But…

Data quality tests – should the pipeline fail or should bad data be allowed through for data quality checks to catch? Ideally test for things which break deployment

## Example Tests

Dates
Data Types
Deployment success
Pipeline speed/capacity
